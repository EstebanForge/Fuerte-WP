== Description ==

🛡️ **ULTIMATE WORDPRESS SECURITY SOLUTION**

Is your WordPress site vulnerable to attacks? Every day, thousands of sites get compromised through weak login security, unrestricted admin access, and exposed login URLs. Fuerte-WP is your fortress against these threats.

**⚠️ STARTLING FACT:**
- 90% of hacked WordPress sites are compromised through brute-force attacks on wp-login.php
- Most WordPress security breaches happen from within - by administrator accounts with too much power
- Your default wp-login.php URL is a public invitation to attackers

**🔥 WHY FUERTE-WP IS DIFFERENT:**

Most security plugins just alert you AFTER an attack. Fuerte-WP PREVENTS attacks before they happen, combining multiple layers of protection that work together seamlessly.

**🚨 BRUTE-FORTRESS™ ATTACK PREVENTION**
- **Intelligent Rate Limiting**: Configurable thresholds (default: 5 attempts in 15 minutes)
- **Progressive Lockouts**: Smart lockouts that get longer with repeated attempts
- **IP & Username Blacklisting**: Automatic blocking of suspicious IPs and usernames
- **Real-Time Threat Detection**: Live dashboard showing current attacks and active lockouts

**👑 ADMINISTRATOR CONTROL SYSTEM**
- **Super User Access**: Designate who has full access (YOU) while restricting others
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Granular control over what different admin roles can do
- **Plugin & Theme Protection**: Prevent other admins from installing, deleting, or modifying critical files
- **Menu Management**: Hide sensitive WordPress menu items from restricted users
- **User Account Shielding**: Protect super user accounts from being edited or deleted

**📊 SECURITY COMMAND CENTER**
- **Live Attack Monitoring**: Real-time AJAX dashboard shows login attempts as they happen
- **Detailed Forensic Logs**: Comprehensive logging with timestamps, IPs, and user agents
- **Export Security Data**: Download logs for analysis or compliance reporting
- **Smart Notifications**: Get alerted about security events and lockouts
- **One-Click Management**: Instantly unblock IPs, clear logs, or reset lockouts

**🇪🇺 GDPR COMPLIANCE MADE EASY**
- **Privacy Notice Builder**: Customizable GDPR compliance messages for login/registration forms
- **Built-in Legal Templates**: Professional default privacy messages if you don't customize
- **Non-Intrusive Design**: Compliance that doesn't hurt user experience
- **Audit Trail**: Logging that helps with GDPR compliance requirements

**⚙️ ADVANCED WORDPRESS HARDENING**
- **Auto-Update Management**: Automated updates for core, plugins, themes, and translations
- **API Security Shield**: Disable XML-RPC, Application Passwords, and restrict REST API
- **Email Protection**: Customize WordPress recovery and sender emails
- **Security Hardening**: Force strong passwords, disable file editors, block weak passwords
- **Performance Optimized**: Background updates that don't slow down your site

**🔐 OPTIONAL: LOGIN URL OBSCURITY**
*For users who want additional obscurity layers*

- **Invisible Login URL**: Replace default `wp-login.php` with custom URLs
- **Smart Redirection**: Send attackers away from your site (404 page or custom URL)
- **WP-Admin Fortress**: Block direct `/wp-admin/` access to unauthorized users
- **Hidden Field Protection**: Advanced CSRF protection against automated attacks

*Note: This feature is disabled by default because true security comes from strong authentication, not hiding URLs.*
