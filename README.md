Take control of your WordPress security & maintenance. Automate plugin updates, manage administrator access, and prevent broken functionality from outdated plugins without proper oversight.

Fuerte-WP is the ultimate WordPress security & maintenance solution that combines automated updates with administrator oversight to prevent plugin conflicts before they break your site.

Available at the official [WordPress.org plugins repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fuerte-wp/).

## Why?

Is your WordPress site suffering from plugin neglect? Every day, thousands of sites break due to outdated plugins, untested updates, and lack of proper maintenance oversight.

**⚠️ THE REALITY:**
- 90% of WordPress site failures are caused by outdated plugins, themes or incompatible updates
- Most WordPress downtime happens from untested plugin updates by administrators with too much freedom
- Your WordPress installation is only as reliable as your maintenance routine

**🔥 WHY FUERTE-WP IS DIFFERENT:**

Most maintenance plugins just alert you AFTER something breaks. Fuerte-WP PREVENTS issues before they happen, combining automated updates with access control that works together seamlessly.

Fuerte-WP auto-protects itself and cannot be disabled, unless your account is declared as super user, or you have access to the server (FTP, SFTP, SSH, cPanel/Plesk, etc.).

## How to Install

**⚡ INSTALL IN SECONDS, MAINTAIN FOR YEARS**

1. Click "Install Now" or search for "Fuerte-WP" in your WordPress dashboard
2. Activate the plugin
3. Visit Settings > Fuerte-WP to configure the settings as you like. Defaults are good if you want to leave them like that
4. Congratulations! Your WordPress site is now professionally maintained.

### Harder configuration (optional)

Fuerte-WP allows you to configure it "harder". This way, Fuerte-WP options inside wp-admin panel aren't even shown at all. Useful to mass deploy Fuerte-WP configuration to multiple WordPress installations.

To use the harder configuration, follow this steps:

- Download a copy of [```config-sample/wp-config-fuerte.php```](https://github.com/EstebanForge/Fuerte-WP/blob/master/config-sample/wp-config-fuerte.php) file, and set it up with your desired settings. Edit and tweak the configuration array as needed.

- Upload your tweaked ```wp-config-fuerte.php``` file to your WordPress's root directory. This usually is where your wp-config.php file resides.

- When Fuerte-WP detects that file, it will load the configuration from it. This will bypass the DB values from the options page, completely.

#### Config file updates

To check if your ```wp-config-fuerte.php``` file need an update, follow this steps:

Check the default [```config-sample/wp-config-fuerte.php```](https://github.com/EstebanForge/Fuerte-WP/blob/master/config-sample/wp-config-fuerte.php) file. The header of the sample config will have the version when it was last modified.

Then check out your own ```wp-config-fuerte.php``` file. If yours has a lower version number, then you need to update your settings array.

Compare your config with the [default wp-config-fuerte.php file](https://github.com/EstebanForge/Fuerte-WP/blob/master/config-sample/wp-config-fuerte.php) and add the new/missing settings to your file. You can use [Meld](https://meldmerge.org), [WinMerge](https://winmerge.org), [Beyond Compare](https://www.scootersoftware.com), [Kaleidoscope](https://kaleidoscope.app), [Araxis Merge](https://www.araxis.com/merge/), [Diffchecker](https://www.diffchecker.com) or any similar software diff to help you here.

Upload your updated ```wp-config-fuerte.php``` to your WordPress's root directory and replace the old one.

Don't worry. New Fuerte-WP features that need new configuration values will not run or affect you until you upgrade your config file and add the new/missing settings.
