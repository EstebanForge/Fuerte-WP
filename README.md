Stronger WP. Limit access to critical WordPress areas, even other for admins.

WP-Fuerte is a WordPress Plugin to enforce certain limits for users with wp-admin access, and to force some other security related tweaks.

## Why?

Because even if you choose to set an user only as Editor, some plugins require users to be an Administrator. And so many Administrators without limits could become an issue, security-wise.

Not only because admins can edit every single configuration inside WordPress. Administrators can also upload plugins or themes, and with them, compromise your WordPress installation.

WP-Fuerte will limit some administrators from access critical WordPress areas that you can define.

WP-Fuerte auto-protect itself and cannot be disabled unless you have access to the server (FTP, SFTP, SSH, cPanel/Plesk, etc.) or your account is declared as a super-admin in WP-Fuerte configuration file.

## How to install

Install the plugin. Activate it.

Set up a copy of the ```wp-config-fuerte.php``` file with your desired settings. Edit and tweak the configuration array as needed.

Upload your tweaked ```wp-config-fuerte.php``` file to your WordPress's root directory. This usually is where your wp-config.php file resides. WP-Fuerte will not run at all if ```wp-config-fuerte.php``` file doesn't exist in that location.

### Upgrade instructions

After updating WP-Fuerte, please check WP-Fuerte version number in your WP's plugins area. WP-Fuerte config file version will match that number.

Then check your own wp-config-fuerte.php file. If yours has a lower version number, then compare your config with the [default wp-config-fuerte.php file](https://github.com/TCattd/WP-Fuerte/blob/master/wp-config-fuerte.php) and add the new/missing settings to your file. You can use [Meld](https://meldmerge.org/) (or similars) to help you here.

Upload your updated wp-config-fuerte.php to your WordPress's root directory, as per install instructions.

Don't worry. New features will not run or affect you until you upgrade your config file and add the new/missing settings.
